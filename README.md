## About

`SACH-AI` is an advanced artificial intelligence solution designed to combat the spread of misinformation and detect fake news across various mediums, including news headlines, articles, links, and even manipulated images and deep fake videos. It utilizes state-of-the-art techniques, such as linguistic analysis, social network analysis, fact-checking, machine learning, crowd-sourcing, and OCR + ML models to provide accurate and reliable results.


## Our Area for Fake/Misinformation Detection

- Text News(Title +- Body)
- Image
- Video


## Key Features

- Detection beyond textual content: SACH-AI goes beyond traditional methods by identifying fake or altered images, ensuring a comprehensive approach to misinformation detection.
- Specialized fine-tuned models: We employ multiple specialized models to extract sentiment, bias, hyperpartisan tendencies, and source credibility, supported by relevant evidence.
- Incremental/Online Learning: Our AI models utilize incremental/online learning techniques, continuously adapting to evolving fake news tactics for enhanced accuracy.
- Diverse approach to fake news detection: SACH-AI combines linguistic analysis (NLP/LLMs), social network analysis, fact-checking (search engines), machine learning (fine-tuned models), crowd-sourcing, and OCR + ML models for fake/altered image and deep fake video detection.
